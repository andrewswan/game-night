<h3>Why OpenID?</h3>
Using OpenID for logging into this site means that users:
* Don't have to remember yet another username and password (assuming they
  already have an OpenID, which you do if you have an account with Google,
  Yahoo, AOL, Blogger, etc.).
* Aren't tempted to reuse their existing username and/or password from some
  other web site, which can be risky if either site is not totally secure. 
* Can choose an OpenID provider that meets their own security criteria, so if
  you want to protect your identity with both a password and a SecureID tag,
  you can do this by choosing an OpenID provider that supports that feature.
* Benefit because this site's developers can concentrate on adding useful
  gaming-related features rather than implementing and maintaining
  security-related features such as changing and resetting of passwords.
