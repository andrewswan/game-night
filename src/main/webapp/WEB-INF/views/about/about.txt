<h3>Why?</h3>
I'm a board gamer and a dad. I developed this site because I want to extract the
greatest possible enjoyment from my limited gaming time. I've always had regular
gaming partners and groups, but sometimes the important question of what to play
is left until the last moment, and often resolved in a fairly arbitrary way.
Planning what to play in advance means that:
* Players can learn or brush up on the rules beforehand, so that the game can
  start more quickly.
* Players who know the rules can brush up on their strategies so that they don't
  keep learning the same lessons all over again each time they play (a
  particular problem for the less frequently played games).
* People can bring exactly the right games to a session, saving effort and
  preventing disappointment.
* Gamers can read up on a proposed game in advance to see if it's their sort of
  game, rather than being swayed by the box cover or other people's opinions.
* No gaming time wasted deciding what to play!
